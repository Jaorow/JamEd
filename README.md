## basic starting foundation, _ideas subject to change_...
a webapp for helping people deside what to cook with followable recipies. 
  - a fridge reposotry with edditable contents (maybe can ask the chat function to add or remove items from the fridge).
  - a shopping list that can be added too (make chat-gpt return a required ingredents list in the same way every time so we can automaticly add it to the "shopping list" if not allready in fridge.
  - a chat page that you can talk to your AI assistant can return to you recipie ideas.


Future: 
  - ability to add recipies to a list of fave recipies.
  - ability to login and share shoping lists with a group of freinds/flat.
